# ynab-key-bindings

If you wanna check this out go for it, but I haven't really documented it yet because:

- I'm kinda just hacking shit together in my extremely limited spare time, usually while I'm very tired
- This is some pretty niche shit that is probably not useful for anyone else.

I might make something more generically useful out of this if the mood strikes me but, dang, I really don't have the time or emotional energy to actively maintain an open source project. It's not super bad when I'm working on something that I'm actively working on, so maybe I just need to be quick on the trigger to mark something as **UNMAINTAINED** the instant I stop caring about it, that's probably the move.

thx 4 reading my ðŸ†’ readme.

## TODO

- try out [alsatian](https://github.com/alsatian-test/alsatian) for tests
